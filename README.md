# yogiBear_react
React.js Frontend

 YogiBear is a booking sight for Yoga Instructors. A user can create an account and book a session with their favorite Yogi. A user can also see all the sessions they have booked and keep track of their charges. An Admin user can add or remove a Yoga instructor to the database, edit instructor information and create their own bookings.
